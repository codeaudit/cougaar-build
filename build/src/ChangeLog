	* all
	Moved CR writer to static in WriterBase.  Added '\n' to println()
	methods to WriterBase and updated all the writer code to use the
	new methods.  Also updated CR notice to 2001.

	* DefRunner
	If the classname doesn't have a "." in it prefix it with
	"org.cougaar.tools.build." This allows def files to have simply
	"#!VersionWriter" instead of ";!generate: org.cougaar.tools.build.VersionWriter"

	Support richer APIs for Measure and Derivative.

	* MeasureWriter
	Support generation of "Derivate denominator" interfaces.  For
	instance, all derivative measures which are with respect to
	Duration now implement the Rate interface.
	Also, changed the "rate=" directive to "derivative=" and did
	some additional minor cleanup.

	base-class values, e.g. Speed(Distance,Duration).

2000-07-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MeasureWriter
	Generate more "final" declarations for increased inlining.

	Add derivative/Rate class generation.

	Rework delegation syntax to add support for explicit creation of
	delegate instances by LDM plugins.  The old behavior may be

	* AssetWriter
	Fix problems with search* methods missing local-slot PGs.

2000-03-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	argument.

	* *Writers
	Moved to build module and org.cougaar.tools.build package from core to eliminate 
	non-runtime classes from core and to make it simpler to build
	non-core packages.
