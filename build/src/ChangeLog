2001-10-15  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/Targets.java (Repository):
	cleanClassFiles cleans test classes too.

2001-10-02  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@HEFEWEIZEN>

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/make_properties.txt (Repository):
	Added a prototypical make.properties file for building cougaar
	modules. This should reduce the learning curve for using make.

2001-09-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/readme.txt:
	Update documentation of new properties and options.

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/Targets.java:
	Make examples and tests along with usual sources.

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/MakeContext.java:
	Compute jikes classpath from a new org.cougaar.tools.make.jdk
	property. This is an alternative to the direct specification of
	the jikes classpath using org.cougaar.tools.make.jikes.class.path.
	Also, compute org.cougaar.tools.make.jdk.tools the same way.

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/Make.java:
	Add -jikes to invoke jikes compiler from command line and
	-pendantic to perform pedantic checking.

2001-09-05  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* VersionWriter
	Be smarter about repository tag & date information.

2001-04-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* org/cougaar/tools/make/MakeContext.java:
	Add -g option to jikes and javac commands to get debug symbols.

	* org/cougaar/tools/fixconfig/FixFood.java:
	Moved some common functions into the Fix superclass.

	* org/cougaar/tools/fixconfig/FixAmmo.java:
	Similar to FixFood but excises non-ammo plugins (e.g. medical,
	subsistence, construction, etc.).

	* org/cougaar/tools/fixconfig/Fix.java:
	Move some methods from FixFood to here. Fix is no longer abstract
	and can be used to abstract a subset of clusters based on a set of
	Role/Relationships. E.g.:
	... Fix -role AmmunitionProvider -role FoodProvider 3-69-ARBN
	will print the contents of a Node ini file suitable for providing
	a complete food and ammunition supply chain.

2001-03-13  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* fixconfig
	This package contains one or more small applications to "fix"
	configuration files by reading and rewriting the cluster ini files
	and removing plugins and plugin parameters. Fix.java is the base
	class that implements the actual fixing. FixFood.java is an
	extension that specifies the fixes needed to strip all by
	subsistence from the configuration.

2001-01-30  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* all
	Moved CR writer to static in WriterBase.  Added '\n' to println()
	methods to WriterBase and updated all the writer code to use the
	new methods.  Also updated CR notice to 2001.

	* DefRunner
	If the classname doesn't have a "." in it prefix it with
	"org.cougaar.tools.build." This allows def files to have simply
	"#!VersionWriter" instead of ";!generate: org.cougaar.tools.build.VersionWriter"
	
2000-09-22  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MeasureWriter
	Support richer APIs for Measure and Derivative.

2000-09-15  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MeasureWriter
	Support generation of "Derivate denominator" interfaces.  For
	instance, all derivative measures which are with respect to
	Duration now implement the Rate interface.
	Also, changed the "rate=" directive to "derivative=" and did
	some additional minor cleanup.

2000-09-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Add beaninfo support for DataQuality-augmented PGImpls.

2000-08-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MeasureWriter
	Fix some Rate measure bugs.

2000-08-17  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Make constructurs of PGImpl public rather than default, including DQ.

2000-08-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Fix: support for "void" return value BG methods.

2000-08-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Added support for per-PG tracking of DataQuality.  See
	core/doc/details/DataQuality.txt for details.

2000-08-01  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MeasureWriter
	Add generation of rate constructors that are in terms of
	base-class values, e.g. Speed(Distance,Duration).

2000-07-31  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* MeasureWriter
	Generate more "final" declarations for increased inlining.

	Add derivative/Rate class generation.

2000-07-18  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Allow deprecated properties to propagate correctly.  deprecated
	directives become just warnings instead of non-functional
	warnings. 

2000-06-29  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Rework delegation syntax to add support for explicit creation of
	delegate instances by LDM plugins.  The old behavior may be
	selected with "foo.auto=true"  
	See ReleaseNotes/ALP6.4/BehaviorGroups.txt for more info.

2000-05-11  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* PGWriter
	Support for delegation syntax and delegated code.  See 
	ReleaseNotes/ALP6.2/BehaviorGroups.txt

2000-04-20  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetWriter, PGWriter
	Support for Null_PGs and Future_PGs.  Lay the groundwork for Late
	binding support, which needs some more thought anyway.

2000-04-13  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetWriter
	Fix problems with search* methods missing local-slot PGs.

2000-03-03  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* AssetWriter
	Support top-level package=foo directive to be equivalent to the -P 
	argument.

	* *Writers
	Moved to build module and org.cougaar.tools.build package from core to eliminate 
	non-runtime classes from core and to make it simpler to build
	non-core packages.
