SYNOPSIS
    build-org.cougaar.pl [args]

DESCRIPTION
    Build alp core, alpine, or a plugin.

OPTIONS
    -p        Build name prefix. Sets prefix part of the build name. ie:
              PREFIX-version-yyyymmdd. Default is 'core'. The prefix
              var (BUILD_PREFIX) is used extensavely throughout the
              build script for identify what to check out from cvs,
              build names, jar names, etc...

    -v        Build name version. Sets version part of build name. ie:
              prefix-VERSION-yyyymmdd. Default is 'HEAD'. (Actually,
              the default is the CVS tag, which is the head).

    -b        Build name location. The location where BUILD_NAME is
              created, and where the build takes place. Default is
              '/build/dist/builds'.

    -d        Distribution destination directory. The location where the
              zip'd distribution will be deposited. Default is
              '/build/dist/zips'.

    -t        CVS tag used for sources. The default is 'HEAD'.

    -T        CVS tag used for build scripts. The default is the same as
              the -t tag.

    -r        CVS root. The default is '/alp/cvs/master'.

    -w        Build with (this build). Not intuitive. Specify a fragment
              of a build name, and this build will try and use jar
              files from the build specified by -w. ie: -w HEAD-
              20000302 will try and use jar files from core-HEAD-
              20000302 and alpine-HEAD-20000302. This is used for
              building 3rd party plugins against existing builds.
              Currently, on jar files in the 'lib' directory are
              searched for. In the future, it might be possible to
              specifiy only the BUILD_VERSION portion, with todays
              date as the default.

    -W        Build with path. A ':' delimited path to directories
              containing jar files. ie:
              /tmp/jardir:/build/dist/morejars. This is a mechanism
              for adding a hardcoded path to directories containing
              jar files. ALL of the jar files within the directory
              will be picked up.

    -i        Interactive. Don't create log, check for errors, or send
              mail. Used mainly for debugging, and silent builds.

    -s        Skip CVS checkout, and directory tree creation. Used for
              restarting a build. Mainly for debugging purposes.

    -S        Skip the recursive build process. Don't build anything.
              Used for debugging, along with the -s flag, portions
              of the build script that occur after the lengthy build
              process.

    -V        Add some verbocity to the messages. Not implemented yet.

    -h        Print some help.

EXAMPLES
    'build-org.cougaar.pl'
              Builds 'core-HEAD-todaysdate' with all of the
              defaults.

    'build-org.cougaar.pl -v alpine -w HEAD-20000302'
              Builds 'alpine-HEAD-todaysdate'. Uses jar files from
              core-HEAD-20000302.

    'build-org.cougaar.pl -v plugin -w HEAD-20000301'
              Builds 'plugin-HEAD-todaysdate'. Uses jar files from
              core-HEAD-20000302 and alpine-HEAD-20000302.

    'build-org.cougaar.pl -W /tmp/jars:/top/morejars'
              Builds with defaults. Adds two directories to be
              searched for jar files.

    'build-org.cougaar.pl -v MB60_Candidate1 -t MB60_Candidate1'
              Build core-MB60_Candidate1-yyyymmdd. User CVS tag
              MB60_Candidate1. Specifying the tag should also change
              the version. I find this more readable.

BUGS
    javadoc   The package 'alp' breaks javadoc, even though it is a
              legit package with the versioning tools. It is removed
              from the automatically generated list of packages fed
              to javadoc.
