Procedure for tagging a build using the build script.

(Note - this is primarily of use for maintainers of the Cambridge
Cougaar CVS repository and build system, but could be useful for
others interested in using the cougaar build system for maintaining
other java projects)

Example: we'll be tagging the exact software which was shipped as
cougaar 9.2.0.  We'll tag it with "V9_2" and we'll make it a branch. 

1. find the date (and, if appropriate, base tag) of the version you
want to tag with the new name.
  - I unpacked the shipped build and looked at build.out for the date
	to use.  You could also unpack any of the zip files and then
	look at any of the files in Manifest/* for the value of
	REPOSITORY_TIME and REPOSITORY_TAG (if not HEAD).
  - for our example:
     DATE = "5/1/2002 15:00:07"
     BASETAG = "HEAD"

2. Run the build script in tag mode.
the build script is in build.jar:build/bin/build, or you can get it
from the build module in the main (cougaar) cvs repository.
You can always run "build -h" to get some help information.

  - our example:

    build -v -D '5/1/2002 15:00:07' -t V9_2 -b

    (	-v	verbose mode
	-D <x>	tag/build the sources as of date/time <x>
	-t <t>	tag with name <t> rather than build.
	-b 	Branch rather than tag )
  - If you are branching, it is a good idea to also do a point tag
  to make sure that you can reconstruct that build.  We'll use the
  following:

    build -v -D '5/1/2002 15:00:07' -r V9_2 -t V9_2_0

    (	-r <t>	tag/build relative to the named branch instead of
		HEAD )

Notes:
 - the build scripts will take a while to run - don't worry.
 - Although the build script ought to work on windows (with cygwin),
I've never tried it.  linux is preferred here.
 - you can use the "-F" flag with build to force the tag if you blew
it and made a mistake.  This turns it into a destructive operation, so
you'd better be completely certain that you are doing things right the
second time!
