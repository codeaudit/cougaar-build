Usage: 
prompt> cd dir/with/AlpMake ; ./AlpMake-wrapper.sh /path/to/src /path/to/dest

AlpMake is a facility for compiling a tree of java files, without
specific knowledge of the tree.  Basically, it traverses the tree
of files, and writes a UNIX shell script, as well as a .bat file,
which will then compile the files.  AlpMake is called from the
appropriate wrapper file, which sets up the environment, compiles
AlpMake, and then executes its output.

The files:  ( cvs co alp-build ; cd build/AlpMake )

AlpMake-wrapper.bat  -- The Win/NT wrapper file.
AlpMake-wrapper.sh   -- The UNIX wrapper file.
AlpMake.java         -- Main
MainFrame.java       -- Gui
MakeHelper.java      -- Work
README               -- This file.


AlpMake-wrapper.* should contain the correct environment for compiling
the tree, and takes two arguments:
1) Path to the source tree.
2) Path to the destination. (Class destination dir)

AlpMake is being tested in the nightly builds.
