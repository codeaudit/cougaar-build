# Port LDM packages from ALP4.0 to ALP5.0 by replacing old
# package names with new package name.  portLDM replaces each file
# on its argument list with the modified version, leaving the old
# version of each file in a file with ".bak" appended.
#
# To run the script (on unix) do the following:
#   cd your/plugin/source/tree
#   portLDM `find . -name "*.java" -print`
